most interesting and noteworthy projects of 2012


2, ghost.py, as one of the 'projects of 2012' voted by pycoder, is introduced as:
http://jeanphix.me/Ghost.py/#javascript
and the github project is at: https://github.com/jeanphix/Ghost.py (while, i do not know how to folk currently)


ghost.py is a webkit web client written in python, whick could analysis javascript in the webpage.  thus, PyQT is needed.  The core of the project is of course the QtWebkit module. 


3, Another opensourse, phantomjs, is doing the same thing, whick also based on Webkit
http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/
this project has both c++ and python version. 
The phantomjs is targeted to interpret JS or CoffieScript code in the server side. 
To compile from the source code, you need the QT, which is very big. Or you could use the binary file directly. 

I've used this to crawl webpage area which contains js code. the command is as:

DISPLAY=:0 ./phantomjs/bin/phantomjs ./get_webpage.js url

and the get_webpage.js is the javascrip code, which open and run the url and print the actural html code to the stdout

var page = new WebPage();
